        // It should be noted that in a real world application, you're not
        // supposed to actually call vkAllocateMemory for every individual
        // buffer. The maximum number of simultaneous memory allocations is
        // limited by the maxMemoryAllocationCount physical device limit,
        // which may be as low as 4096 even on high end hardware like an
        // NVIDIA GTX 1080. The right way to allocate memory for a large
        // number of objects at the same time is to create a custom allocator
        // that splits up a single allocation among many different objects by
        // using the offset parameters that we've seen in many functions.
        //
        // You can either implement such an allocator yourself, or use the
        // VulkanMemoryAllocator library provided by the GPUOpen initiative. However,
        // for this tutorial it's okay to use a separate allocation for every
        // resource, because we won't come close to hitting any of these limits for
        // now.
        //
        // The previous chapter already mentioned that you should allocate
        // multiple resources like buffers from a single memory allocation,
        // but in fact you should go a step further. Driver developers
        // recommend that you also store multiple buffers, like the vertex and
        // index buffer, into a single VkBuffer and use offsets in commands
        // like vkCmdBindVertexBuffers. The advantage is that your data is
        // more cache friendly in that case, because it's closer together. It
        // is even possible to reuse the same chunk of memory for multiple
        // resources if they are not used during the same render operations,
        // provided that their data is refreshed, of course. This is known as
        // aliasing and some Vulkan functions have explicit flags to specify
        // that you want to do this.

        // * Use a memory heap that is host coherent, indicated with
        //   VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT (or)
        // * Call vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges to after writing to the mapped
        //   memory, and call vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges before reading from
